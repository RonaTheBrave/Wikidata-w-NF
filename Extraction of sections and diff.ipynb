Some recent placebo-controlled trials have found that it may be no better than a placebo for some causes including acute cough in children. As a consequence, it is not recommended for children. Additionally, there is no evidence that hydrocodone is useful in children. Similarly, a 2012 Dutch guideline regarding the treatment of acute cough does not recommend its use. (The opioid analogue dextromethorphan, long claimed to be as effective a cough suppressant as codeine, has similarly demonstrated little benefit in several recent studies.)\\nLow dose morphine may help chronic cough but its use is limited by side effects.'"
